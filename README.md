# Crypto Sentiment Dashboard

A beginner-friendly Next.js application that displays cryptocurrency sentiment data from the LunarCrush API. This dashboard helps users visualize and understand market sentiment around different cryptocurrencies.

## üìö What is Crypto Sentiment?

Crypto sentiment refers to the overall attitude or feeling that investors and the public have toward a specific cryptocurrency. This dashboard displays two key sentiment metrics:

- **Sentiment Score**: A value (0-100) that represents social media sentiment about a cryptocurrency. Higher scores indicate more positive public sentiment.
- **Galaxy Score**: A combined rating (0-100) that considers multiple factors including price volatility, social media activity, and market trends.
