# LunarCrush API Configuration
# -----------------------
# Get your API key from https://lunarcrush.com/developers/api
# After signing up, copy your key below (without quotes)

LUNARCRUSH_API_TOKEN=your_api_key_here

# How to use:
# 1. Copy this file and rename it to .env.local
# 2. Replace 'your_api_key_here' with your actual LunarCrush API key
# 3. Restart the development server if it's already running

# Note: .env.local is in .gitignore to keep your API key private
